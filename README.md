## Inspiration
TMU downtown campus is fairly big and is mixed in with many other buildings. It took me a while to get used to the area and understand where everything is located. Given this problem, I thought of making a fun way of exploring the downtown campus with Three.js, React and Blender.

## Wanna toy around with the project?

Boot it up as any other react project

### Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Spin up environment
```
npm run start
```

After running the command, open http://localhost:3000 to view the project in the browser.
